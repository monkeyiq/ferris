This directory contains some patches to third party tools which are
either in the process of being included into those other projects or
are not yet at that level but which might still be useful to libferris
users.

You should check with the project that the patch is for to see if
it has already been included.

The TRAMP patch is against tramp-2.1.17 and needs to be reworked to
use defvar and other customizations so it does not clobber the
existing commands in TRAMP to force libferris usage.
